# CTF Writeups Collection

A comprehensive collection of detailed writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and challenges.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions and methodologies for CTF challenges across multiple categories, serving as both documentation and learning resource for the cybersecurity community.

## Categories Covered

### Web Exploitation
- SQL Injection techniques and bypasses
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploitation
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Authentication and authorization bypasses

### Cryptography
- Classical cipher breaking
- RSA cryptanalysis
- Hash function vulnerabilities
- Block cipher attacks

### Reverse Engineering
- Binary analysis and disassembly
- Malware analysis techniques
- Protocol reverse engineering
- Firmware analysis

## Notable Achievements

### HackTheBox Challenges
- **Web**: Solved 25+ web application challenges
- **Crypto**: Completed advanced cryptographic puzzles
- **Reversing**: Analyzed complex binary executables

### Competition Results
- **CyberDefenders**: Top 10% ranking
- **PicoCTF**: 2500+ points achieved
- **OverTheWire**: Completed Bandit, Natas, and Krypton series

## Methodology

Each writeup follows a structured approach:

1. **Challenge Analysis**: Understanding the problem scope
2. **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering and enumeration
3. **Exploitation**: Step-by-step attack methodology
4. **Documentation**: Clear explanation of techniques used

## Example: SQL Injection Bypass

```sql
-- Original query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$input' AND password='$pass'

-- Payload to bypass authentication
admin'--

-- Resulting query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' AND password='$pass'
```

## Tools and Techniques

- **Burp Suite**: Web application security testing
- **Ghidra**: Reverse engineering and binary analysis
- **John the Ripper**: Password cracking
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analysis
- **Custom Python scripts**: Automation and exploitation

## Community Impact
