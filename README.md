# Portfolio (starter)

This is a starter Next.js portfolio scaffold tailored for a cyber-security student.
It uses MDX files under `content/` for projects, about, and resume.

## Quick start (local)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run in development:
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

3. Build:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## GitHub / Deploy

Initialize a git repo and push to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial portfolio scaffold"
# Create repo on GitHub (replace URL)
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then connect the GitHub repo to Vercel (or Netlify) for automatic deployments.

## What I generated for you

- Full file structure with pages, components, and MDX content
- Example project MDX and certification
- Simple contact API (needs hooking to email provider)
- Tailwind CSS integration
